                        <p>Nuenen was smaller than Etten, and in December 1883 it must have seemed unlikely that Van
                            Gogh
                            would spend almost two years here, in close proximity to his family. His parents put
                            themselves
                            out to understand and come to terms with their prodigal son, even repairing an old shed that
                            had
                            been used for laundering so that Vincent could have a private studio outside of parsonage.
                            Relations remained uneasy and he was soon complaining to Theo that ‘the welcome home was in
                            every respect kind and cordial, but at bottom there is not the least change in what i must
                            call
                            their blindness to, and their total lack of understanding of, the relations between us.
                        </p>
                        <p>Evidently it never occurred to Van Gogh that a couple in their sixties were not likely to
                            change
                            their ideas radically, or that the onus of maintaining satisfactory relations might lie with
                            him. In many ways he was at his most unreasonable in his dealing with family, blaming his
                            father
                            for corrupting Theo by encouraging his business career, and blaming Theo alternately for
                            remaining a businessman and for not pushing Vincent’s paintings energetically enough. In
                            calmer
                            moments, he realized how much he owed Theo (and not just financially), and in February 1884
                            he
                            began to pay Theo for his regular subsidies by sending him paintings. Soon he was sending
                            all of
                            his paintings to Paris, declaring that everything he created was in reality a joint effort,
                            for
                            which Theo deserved at least half the credit.

                        <p>Vincent Van Gogh was one of the greatest pioneers of modern art. Almost everything
                            forward-looking in painting and sculpture was nourished in Paris between the 1850’s and the
                            early years of World War II. Not surprisingly, then, Van Gogh’s experience was one of the
                            crucial events in his life: without it he would have been an entirely different sort of
                            artist.
                        </p>
                        <p>The impact of Paris on Van Gogh is the most evident in his canvases. Van Gogh was exposed to
                            both
                            Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism simultaneously, and their influences were felt, slowly
                            but
                            surely, in his painting. His actual movements are hard to trace, as we have few letters
                            written
                            by him: he was living with Theo, his principal correspondent, so there was no need to
                            communicate with the pen. He had the company of his brother to assuage his loneliness and a
                            great city’s picturesque views and a variety of life to entertain him.

                    <p>Van Gogh left Paris on 20 February, 1888. At the end of a long journey by train to Arles, he
                        discovered that the sunny south was covered in winter snow. Then, despite the unusually late fall of
                        snow, blossoms began to appear on the trees and Van Gogh, like many artists before him, was
                        overwhelmed with joy on first experiencing the light and color of the South.
                    </p>
                    <p>Van Gogh himself wrote that he struck a ‘high yellow note’ in the summer of 1888. Although it would
                        be rash to assert that Van Gogh had a ‘favorite’ color, he certainly saw yellow as the key to the
                        South, instancing his hero Monticelli, who had painted it ‘all yellow, orange, and sulphur colors

                    <p>The asylum of St-Paul-de-Mausole was situated a kilometre or so outside the town of St. Remy, in
                        the
                        countryside no doubt chosen to afford maximum peace and quiet for the occupants. By 1889,
                        however,
                        the place seems to have fallen on evil days. The entire asylum had a run-down air. Accustomed to
                        an
                        austere way of life, he seemed untroubled by the gloom of the place and even took some comfort
                        from
                        the knowledge he was not alone in suffering from hallucinations.
